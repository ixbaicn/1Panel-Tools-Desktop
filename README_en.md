# 1Panel-Tools

[English](README_en.md) ｜ [Chinese](README.md)
## Overview

1Panel-Tools is a specialized toolkit designed to simplify the process of creating applications for the 1Panel AppStore. The primary tool in this collection is the Docker Compose to 1Panel AppStore converter, which transforms standard Docker Compose files into the format required by the 1Panel AppStore.

## Features

- **Docker Compose Conversion**: Automatically convert Docker Compose files to 1Panel AppStore format
- **Parameter Configuration**: Easily define and manage application parameters
- **Metadata Management**: Set application name, description, tags, and other metadata
- **Multi-language Support**: Configure descriptions in both English and Chinese
- **Export Functionality**: Download the converted files ready for 1Panel AppStore submission

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v10 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arch3rPro/1Panel-Tools.git
cd 1Panel-Tools

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will automatically redirect to the Docker Compose to 1Panel AppStore converter tool.


### Desktop App (Tauri)

This project now includes a Tauri 2 desktop target under `src-tauri/`. The integration follows the official Tauri setup flow (install `@tauri-apps/cli` + `@tauri-apps/api`, then scaffold with `tauri init`).

```bash
# Local desktop development
npm run tauri:dev

# Build desktop bundles
npm run tauri:build
```

## Usage

1. **Input Docker Compose**: Paste your Docker Compose file into the editor
2. **Configure Application**: Set the application name, key, description, and other metadata
3. **Define Parameters**: Add parameters for your application (ports, environment variables, etc.)
4. **Preview Conversion**: Review the generated 1Panel AppStore files
5. **Export**: Download the converted files for use with 1Panel AppStore

### Docker Usage

#### Using Docker Run

```bash
# Pull and run the Docker image
docker run -d --name 1panel-tools -p 8080:8080 vuldocker/1panel-tools:latest
```

Access the tool at http://localhost:8080

#### Using Docker Compose

Use `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content and set port:

```yaml

services:
  1panel-tools:
    image: vuldocker/1panel-tools:latest
    container_name: 1panel-tools
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the tool at http://localhost:8080
